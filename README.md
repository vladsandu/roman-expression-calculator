## Roman expression calculator

- **Disclaimer:** This is an older piece of code written some time ago so it's not that greatly structured.
- Made in Java, this small program is able to calculate any algebraic expressions written using Roman numerals.
- E.g.: ((I + II * III - IV) * V + VI * (VII + VIII) + IX - X + XI + XII / III) * II
- See unit tests for more examples
- Supported operators: + - * / ^
